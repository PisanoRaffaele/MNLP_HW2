In the main file there is the base model implementation and there's also the possiblity to train the model on the train-base dataset + train-adv generated dataset for the extra part. (the trainset generated is in the file 'train_dataset_r.json)

In the augment file there's the code to augment the basic training set.

In the extra file there's the modified version of the model for the extra points.

Bye :)
